# SAHAAYAK: THE NEURAL CIVIC ENGINE 🇮🇳 (PURE FLUTTER)

Sahaayak is a next-generation AI assistant designed for rural India. It bridges the gap between complex government infrastructure and the common citizen through intuitive, dialect-aware voice interactions.

This version is **100% Flutter**, meaning the AI engine and logic run locally on the device with no external dependencies on other languages like Python.
